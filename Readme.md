# WebGi Jewelry Landing Page
A template for buildind scrollable landing pages with Gsap, ScrollTrigger and webgi engine in typescript using parcel bundler.

In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN3bxj3Iep8" target="_blank">this video</a>, you can watch the design process of this page, using WEBGi. Using the scroll to tell stories is something very pleasant and simple to do with tools like WEBGI. It uses a <strong>modified version of Threejs</strong> to allow advanced effects rendering with good performance and ease of use.

All the code responsible for rendering is only 20 lines long. The rest of the code handles the interface, with the Scroll-based animations using the GSAP ScrollTrigger, which is quite powerful for building experiences like this.
